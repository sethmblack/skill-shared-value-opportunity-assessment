# Shared Value Opportunity Assessment

Identify opportunities to create economic value while simultaneously creating value for society using Porter's Creating Shared Value (CSV) framework.

**Token Budget:** ~650 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Confuse shared value with philanthropy or CSR
- Recommend social initiatives disconnected from business value
- Ignore the economic case for social impact
- Greenwash — claiming shared value where none exists

**Key distinction:** Shared value is NOT about redistributing existing value. It is about expanding the total pool of economic and social value through business innovation.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How can we create shared value?" or "CSV analysis"
- User wants to connect social impact with business strategy
- User asks "How can social initiatives drive profit?"
- When developing sustainability or ESG strategy with business impact
- User asks "What's the business case for [social initiative]?"
- When evaluating whether social programs should be strategic priorities

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **company** | Yes | The company to analyze |
| **industry** | Yes | Industry context |
| **social_challenges** | No | Specific social or environmental challenges to consider |
| **operating_context** | No | Key markets, communities, or geographies |

**Input Validation:**
- Must understand the business model to connect social value to economic value
- Must understand operating context to identify relevant social challenges

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Business Model

Before identifying shared value opportunities:
- What is the company's value proposition?
- Who are the customers?
- What is the value chain?
- What are the key cost and differentiation drivers?

### Step 2: Analyze Three Levels of Shared Value

**Level 1: Reconceiving Products and Markets**
- What societal needs could be met through products/services?
- What underserved markets could be profitably accessed?
- How could products be redesigned to address social issues?

Questions to ask:
- What social problems intersect with what we sell?
- Who is underserved by current market offerings?
- How could we modify products to be healthier, safer, more accessible, more sustainable?
- What new markets would open if we addressed a social need?

**Level 2: Redefining Productivity in the Value Chain**
- Where do social problems affect productivity?
- Where could social improvements reduce costs?
- Where could employee or community investments improve operations?

Questions to ask:
- Where are there environmental costs embedded in our value chain?
- Where could energy efficiency, water efficiency, or waste reduction improve margins?
- How does employee health, skills, or engagement affect productivity?
- How do supplier capabilities affect our costs and quality?
- Where does community infrastructure affect our operations?

**Level 3: Enabling Local Cluster Development**
- What weaknesses in the local cluster hurt the business?
- What community investments would improve competitiveness?
- What industry-wide improvements would benefit all players?

Questions to ask:
- What skills gaps affect our ability to hire?
- What infrastructure limitations affect our operations?
- What supplier or service provider weaknesses hurt us?
- What regulatory or institutional gaps create friction?

### Step 3: Assess Business Value

For each opportunity, evaluate:
- Revenue impact (new markets, premium pricing, customer loyalty)
- Cost impact (efficiency, risk reduction, productivity)
- Risk reduction (regulatory, reputational, supply chain)
- Competitive advantage (differentiation, barriers to entry)

### Step 4: Assess Social Value

For each opportunity, evaluate:
- Scale of impact (how many people affected?)
- Depth of impact (how significant is the change?)
- Sustainability (does it create lasting change?)
- Measurability (can we track outcomes?)

### Step 5: Prioritize Opportunities

Rank opportunities by:
- Business value potential (High / Medium / Low)
- Social value potential (High / Medium / Low)
- Feasibility (High / Medium / Low)
- Strategic fit with existing capabilities

## Shared Value vs. CSR

| Corporate Social Responsibility | Creating Shared Value |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| Value: doing good | Value: economic and social benefits relative to cost |
| Citizenship, philanthropy | Joint company and community value creation |
| Discretionary or responding to pressure | Integral to competing |
| Agenda determined externally | Agenda company-specific, internally generated |
| Impact limited by corporate footprint | Realigns entire company budget |
| Example: Fair trade purchasing | Example: Transforming procurement to increase quality and yield |

### Not Shared Value (CSR/Philanthropy)

[Note any social activities that are valuable but not shared value—they don't create business value. These may still be worth doing but should be classified correctly.]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No obvious shared value opportunities | Focus on Level 2 (value chain) — almost always has opportunities |
| User wants to label philanthropy as shared value | Explain the distinction; both are valid, but different |
| Insufficient information about operations | Focus on industry-typical opportunities |
| Conflicting social and business priorities | Acknowledge tension; shared value is not always possible |
| Skepticism about business case | Ground recommendations in specific economic mechanisms |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "Assess shared value opportunities for a large food company"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks

---

### Not Shared Value (CSR/Philanthropy)

- Charitable donations to food banks (valuable but not connected to competitive advantage)
- Community grants unrelated to supply chain (good citizenship but not CSV)
- Volunteerism programs (employee engagement but not business value creation)

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Michael Porter** expert methodology. Shared value assessment connects to:
- **value-chain-mapping** — Level 2 opportunities emerge from value chain analysis
- **five-forces-industry-analysis** — Shared value can address competitive forces
- **generic-strategy-assessment** — Shared value can support differentiation

**Voice:** Maintain Porter's focus on economic logic. Shared value is not charity—it is a new way to achieve competitive advantage while addressing societal challenges.
